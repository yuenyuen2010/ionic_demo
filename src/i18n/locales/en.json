    "whatIsTitle": "What is Tagalog?",
    "whatIsContent": "Tagalog is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by the ethnic Tagalog people, who make up a quarter of the population of the Philippines. It is the basis for Filipino, the national language.",
    "historyTitle": "A Brief History",
    "historyContent": "The name Tagalog comes from 'tagá-ilog', meaning 'river dweller'. Before the Spanish arrival in the 16th century, Tagalog was written in a script called Baybayin. Over 333 years of Spanish rule introduced thousands of loanwords (like 'lamesa' from 'la mesa', 'silya' from 'silla').",
    "featuresTitle": "Special Features",
    "feature1Title": "Focus System",
    "feature1Content": "Unlike English, Tagalog verbs change their form to indicate which part of the sentence is the focus (the actor, the object, the location, etc.). This is often marked by 'ang'.",
    "feature2Title": "Politeness (Po & Opo)",
    "feature2Content": "Respect is built into the grammar. Using 'po' and 'opo' is essential when speaking to elders or people in authority.",
    "feature3Title": "Inclusive vs Exclusive 'We'",
    "feature3Content": "Tagalog has two words for 'we': 'Tayo' (includes the listener) and 'Kami' (excludes the listener).",
    "funFactsTitle": "Fun Facts",
    "fact1": "The English word 'boondocks' comes from the Tagalog word 'bundok' (mountain).",
    "fact2": "'Mahal' means both 'love' and 'expensive'.",
    "fact3": "Repeating a word often diminishes its meaning or makes it 'pseudo'. E.g., 'bahay' (house) -> 'bahay-bahayan' (play house)."
